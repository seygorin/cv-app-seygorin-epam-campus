# CV App

This project is a comprehensive CV (Curriculum Vitae) application built with the modern web development stack including TypeScript, Next.js, CSS Modules, Jest, and Redux-Toolkit. The app allows users to create, edit, and manage their professional resumes efficiently.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances code quality.
- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering and static site generation for fast, SEO-friendly web applications.
- **CSS Modules**: Enables modular and scoped CSS for better styling management.
- **Jest**: Facilitates testing with a robust and flexible testing framework.
- **Redux-Toolkit**: Simplifies state management with a set of tools and best practices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, follow these steps:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can start editing the application by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes, thanks to Next.js's hot-reloading feature.

## Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, ensuring that the app looks great with high-quality typography.
