              I am <em> age &gt; 30 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 35</em>: solving
              problems and searching for solutions is what I love. After
              graduating from university at <em>Math.ceil(22.5)</em> with a
              degree in geology, I dove headfirst into the profession,
              navigating the challenging path of developing oil and gas fields
              and leading several subsoil use projects. These projects concluded
              with the successful completion of work and final presentations in
              various ministries in Kazakhstan. Five years flew by with
              excitement, but at some point, I realized that I was also
              irresistibly drawn to the virtual world, the world of complex
              algorithms and limitless possibilities â€“{' '}

                the world of programming
              </span>
              . <br />
              On my path to acquiring new knowledge, my trusty compass has been
              courses from{' '}
              <em>
                RS School, EPAM, and numerous courses on the Udemy platform
              </em>
              . Over years of theoretical training, I have come to understand a
              simple principle: <strong>practice &gt; theory</strong>. <br />
              The journey of a novice is thorny, but each success, whether it
              was developing a calculator or an online store, only fueled my
              interest. <br />
              Today, armed with knowledge of programming languages:{' '}
              <em>HTML, CSS, JS, and React/Redux</em>, I am ready for new
              challenges. My goal is to become part of a team that does not fear
              difficult tasks and strives to create truly innovative products.
              My experience as a geologist has taught me to think
              systematically, analyze large amounts of information, and find
              unconventional solutions - qualities that I am confident will be
              valuable in the IT world.
